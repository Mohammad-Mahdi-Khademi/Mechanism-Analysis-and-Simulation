## üìê Methodology  

### 1. Graphical Analysis  
- Position of joints found using geometric construction.  
- Velocity and acceleration diagrams drawn to compute angular/linear velocities and accelerations.  

### 2. Analytical Analysis  
- Derived equations for position, velocity, and acceleration.  
- Static analysis performed by applying external forces (e.g., 500 lb on link 2).  
- Dynamic analysis carried out by assigning masses/inertias to links and applying external forces (e.g., 30 lb).  

### 3. SolidWorks Simulation  
- Each link modeled and assembled with proper constraints.  
- Initial velocity applied to input link.  
- Motion Analysis module used to extract position, velocity, and acceleration plots.  

### 4. ADAMS Simulation  
- Mechanism reconstructed with revolute joints.  
- Simulations performed both without friction and with joint friction.  
- Plots generated for angular/linear velocities, accelerations, and reaction forces.  

### 5. MATLAB Simulation  
- Wrote MATLAB scripts to calculate angular velocities, accelerations, and forces.  
- Used symbolic equations and numerical solving for link kinematics.  
- Generated plots for angular motion, velocity, and acceleration of each link.

## üìä Results  
- Graphical & Analytical methods gave consistent results with small differences due to drawing errors.  
- SolidWorks results confirmed manual analysis with close agreement.  
- ADAMS simulations validated kinematics and provided detailed dynamic force analysis.  
- MATLAB implementation successfully automated the process and produced plots for all link motions.
